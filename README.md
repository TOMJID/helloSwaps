# 📱 Mobile‑First Design

</div>

Instead of building for desktop and “squeezing” it down, this page starts with the smallest screen in mind and progressively enhances layouts with media queries for larger sizes.

This ensures:

- Faster loading on smaller screens
- Cleaner layouts for mobile users (the vast majority today!)
- Progressive improvements for tablets and desktops
