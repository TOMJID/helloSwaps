## 📱 Mobile‑First Design

Instead of building for desktop and “squeezing” it down, this page starts with the smallest screen in mind and progressively enhances layouts with media queries for larger sizes.

This ensures:

- Faster loading on smaller screens
- Cleaner layouts for mobile users (the vast majority today!)
- Progressive improvements for tablets and desktops

## 👨‍💻 Author

This README provides a professional explanation but still feels welcoming for anyone glancing at your repo. It highlights **mobile‑first design** and explains the page sections clearly so future recruiters or collaborators instantly understand your project.

Would you like me to also create a **shorter “resume‑friendly” version** of the README (tight, 6–7 lines), so you can use it in a portfolio setting?
